# Quiz 15

Create an JS object called `person` that has the following properties:

- `name` with a value of your name
- `age` with a value of your age
- `hobbies` with a value of an array of your hobbies

```js
// your code here
let person = {
	name: ['Sakhile'],
	age: 16,
	hobbies: ['Napping', 'Cooking', 'Gaming']
};
```

Now change the value of the `age` property to add one year.

```js
// your code here
person.age = 17;
```

Now add a new property called `pets` with a value of an array of your pets.

```js
// your code here
person.pets = 'Dog';
```

What's the difference between creating an object for a JSON file and creating an object in a JS file?

JSON files require all strings to use double quotes.
