			<p>
				BUENOS AIRES - Lionel Messi capped a night of unbridled joy with the 800th goal of his career as world champions
				Argentina celebrated their homecoming with a 2-0 friendly victory over stubborn Panama in Buenos Aires on
				Thursday.
			</p>

			<p>
				The 35-year-old seven-time Ballon d'Or winner's stunning free-kick in the dying minutes came after 21-year-old
				MLS sensation Thiago Almada gave a glimpse of what the future holds with his first goal for the national team in
				only his third appearance.
			</p>

			<p>
				It was clear that this was more a celebration than a football match but Panama clearly had not read the script.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite fielding a weakened side, they were organized and disciplined and managed to frustrate the new world
				champions for 78 minutes before their defenses were finally breached.
			</p>

			<p>
				Argentina, who started the game playing champagne football, created relatively little given their 73 percent
				possession in the first period.
			</p>

			<p>
				Messi struck the woodwork with a freekick while Enzo Fernandez brought a diving one-handed save out of
				goalkeeper Jose Carlos Guerra with a shot from distance.
			</p>

			<p>
				Scaloni had picked the same starting XI that faced France in the World Cup final in December -- when Argentina
				triumphed 4-2 on penalties after a sensational 3-3 draw -- but after a goalless first half he made three
				changes.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the second period, Argentina knuckled down to trying to win a football match but Guerra was twice equal to
				Messi free-kicks and also saved a low curling effort from veteran Angel Di Maria.
			</p>

			<p>
				As the minutes ticked by, the tension rose with Argentina acutely aware that their party risked falling flat if
				they did not win.
			</p>

			<p>But, eventually their main man came to the fore and ensured Panama would not be party poopers.</p>

			<p>
				Messi had a hand in the opening goal, crashing another free-kick off the woodwork, with Almada, a second half
				substitute, following up to slot home.
			</p>

			<p>The stadium erupted and the tension drained from Argentina's players, by now mostly substitutes</p>

			<p>
				With a minute to go, Messi was given yet another free-kick within shooting range -- his fifth of the match --
				and this time he curled it into the top corner to seal the dream scenario for his delirious fans.
			</p>

			<p>
				Then the party continued with singing and dancing and a video recap of Argentina's glorious run to their third
				world title on the stadium's giant screens.
			</p>

			<p>
				No one left as the players, accompanied by partners and children, embarked on a lap of honor, each clutching
				their own replica trophy.
